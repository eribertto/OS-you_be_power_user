In Linux, there are many popular text editors that we can use to modify files. We won't have enough time to cover them all. So let's just focus on one editor that can be found on virtually any distribution, Nano. Nano is an extremely lightweight but useful text editor. We've included it in the supplementary readings after this video, so go check it out. To edit a file in Nano, just type Nano then the file name. Once we do that, we'll be launched into the Nano program. From here, we can start editing content as we normally would with any other text editor. At the bottom of the screen, you'll notice a few options like caret G and caret K. The caret means to use Ctrl-G or Ctrl-K. We won't talk about all these options, but a few that might be useful are Ctrl-G, which helps open up a help page, and Ctrl-X which is used when you want to save your work or exit Nano. Let's go ahead and edit this file, then save our changes. It's asking me if I want to save the file or exit and discard my changes. I'm just going to hit Y because I want to save them. Once I do that, I'll be exited from Nano. Let's verify we actually changed that file. There it is. Nano is a super useful tool if you need a quick text editor in Linux. But if you want to be a true OS power user, I recommend that you read the supplemental material I've included to learn more about the text editors that are used in the industry, like Vim or Emacs.
