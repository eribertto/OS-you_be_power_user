In Bash, the command to make a new directory is the same as in Windows. Let's make a new directory called my cool folder with the mkdir or make directory command. And now, we can verify my cool folder is in our desktop. Instead of using back ticks like in windows to escape a character, in Bash, you can use a backslash. Similar to Windows, you can also use quotes to encompass an entire file name. How do you think you would make a directory called my cool folder in Linux with spaces? mkdir my\ cool\ folder. There it is. Or, mkdir ' my cool folder'. Works as well. If you guessed this, you're right. If you guessed wrong, that's okay. Just re-watch this video so you can get a better grasp of how we came to this conclusion.
