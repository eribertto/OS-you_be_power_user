Remember from the first course in our
program, Technical Support Fundamentals, that we introduced the concept of logs? A log is like your computer's diary, it
records events that happen on your system. What kind of events, well,
pretty much everything. Like when your system shuts down, when it starts up, when a driver's loaded,
when someone logs in. All of these things can
be written to a log. It's also written with a lot of detail. Logs tell you the exact time that an event
occurred, who caused the event, and more. We'll be looking into some
sample log snippets in the upcoming lessons to get
a better sense of how to read one. The act of creating log
events is called logging. Your system does a pretty good job of
logging events right out of the box. In most systems, there is a service
that runs in the background and constantly writes events to logs. These systems are customizable so you
can log any specific field you want, but by default it logs all the essentials. By the end of this lesson, you'll learn where all the important logs
are kept on the Windows and Linux OSes. You'll also learn how to read a log and utilize common troubleshooting
practices when it comes to logs. When you're working in IT support, you'll need to gather as much data
as you can to troubleshoot an issue. Logs tell us important things
like errors that occurred, changes that were made, etc. They are a reliable source of information.
