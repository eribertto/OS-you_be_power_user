We talked about making and copying files and directories so far. But what if we wanted to rename something that we've created? Well, in the Windows GUI, if you are to rename a file, we just right-click and rename. In the command line, if we wanted to rename a file, we can use the move or move item command. It lets us rename files. Lets move the file without changing the directory that it's stored in. On my desktop here, I have blue document and I'm going to move or rename it to yellow document. Now, you can see that I have a yellow document. As you might guess, the move command also lets us move files from one directory to another. Let's move the yellow document into My Documents. I can verify that. There it is, cool. You can even move multiple files by using wildcards. And now you can see, the rest of my colored documents went into My Documents.
