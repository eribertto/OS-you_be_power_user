Wow. We've covered a lot of material so far. In the last lesson, We went over
how to install, uninstall, and maintain software in the Windows and Linux OSs.
These are tasks that you'll find yourself doing over and over as an IT support
specialist. In this lesson, we're going to cover another very important function
of an IT support specialist; working with disks. In our first course, Technical
Support fundamentals, we learned about physical disks like hard disk drives and
SSDs. In this lesson, we're going to expand on that and talk about the tools
needed to make a disk usable on a computer. Ready? Let's get started.
