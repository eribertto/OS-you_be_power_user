When a mobile device is built, it's installed with an operating
system at the factory. So a factory reset returns the device back to
the state it was in when the device well
shipped from the factory. You'll have to factory
reset mobile devices a lot as an IT
support specialist. You might do this before reassigning a device
to another end-user, before sending a
device out for repair, or as a last resort when troubleshooting a
misbehaving device. Don't forget a factory
reset will remove all data apps and
customization from the device. Make sure that anything
you don't want to lose has been backed up or
synced to the Cloud. We'll cover mobile
device synchronization and backup in a future video. Another heads up, watch
out for expansion storage. Additional storage
devices like SD cards or USB drives can contain
personal or proprietary data. Doing a factory reset
while expansion storage is attached might erase data
that you intend to keep. Just as bad, the factory
reset for lots of devices may leave the contents of expansion storage intact. You don't want to
re-purpose or decommission a device with personal or proprietary data still attached. One final thing, in
Android and iOS you need the primary account
credentials in order to perform a factory reset. This is so stolen
devices can not be easily factory reset
and then resold. Overtime, mobile device
manufacturers will release updates to the
devices operating system. These updates will
usually be delivered over the air or OTA. OTA update is one
that's downloaded and installed by the
mobile device itself. There are times when you
might need to use a computer to install operating
system updates, some mobile devices like fitness trackers and
medical devices might not have mobile or WiFi
network interfaces to contact the internet with. Maybe the mobile device
won't boot or doesn't have a good enough data connection to download the update itself. In these cases you can re-flash or overwrite the OS of the
device from a computer. But be careful, pay
close attention to the devices instructions
for re-flashing. For some devices re-flashing will preserve the end-user
data on the device, but for others the end result will be like a factory reset. The details will be different
from one device to another. The basic steps are: one, download the update
to a computer; two, attach the mobile device to a
computer using a USB cable; and then three run
some software on the computer that will
re-flash the mobile device. In the supplemental reading, you'll find instructions
on how to restore iOS and Android devices
from a computer. For other kinds of devices, refer to the device manufacturers
documentation on how to perform a factory reset or
re-flash using a computer.
