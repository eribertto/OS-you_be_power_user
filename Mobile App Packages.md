Now, let's talk about software and mobile
operating systems. We're going to mostly use
examples from iOS and Android. But other mobile operating
systems work in a similar way. If your mobile device is
using a specialized OS, you'll find information
on how that software works and the devices
documentation. Software for mobile
OS's is distributed as mobile applications or apps. Apps have to come
from a source that the mobile device has
been configured to trust. On most OS's, you
can't just download an app from a random
website and install it. Instead, mobile operating
systems use app stores. App stores are a central
managed marketplace for app developers to publish
and sell mobile apps. The App Store app acts
like a Package Manager, and the App Store Service acts
like a package repository. People use App Stores to access free and paid applications from a central source through
a single interface. Apps published
through an App Store have usually been through a security review and have been approved by the store owner. Apps published
through an App Store are signed by the
developer of the app. Though OS is configured to
only trust code that's been signed by publishers
that it recognizes. We'll talk more about
co-signing in a future module. For now, just think of it
like signing a letter. The developer is
saying I wrote this. There's one way that code signing is different than
signing a letter though. If anyone changes the code, the signature becomes invalid. This lets the operating system know if the code's
been tampered with. Centralized App Stores work great for apps that are
available to the public. But what if your
organization needs to run some type of custom App? You'll need to use
enterprise app management, which allows an organization to distribute custom mobile apps. These apps were developed
by or for the organization, and aren't available
to the general public. Enterprise apps are assigned with an enterprise
certificate that has to be trusted by the devices that are installing
the applications. As an IT Support Specialist, you might help manage enterprise
app installation through the mobile device
management or MDM service, which we'll learn about
in a future video. There's one other way to install
an app into a mobile OS, and that's called side-loading. Side-loading is where you install mobile apps directly
without using an App Store. Side-loading packages is riskier than installing
through an App Store, and you would generally only do this if you're
an app developer. Mobile apps are standalone
software packages. So they contain all
their dependencies. When you install an app, it will already have everything
it needs to run baked in. Mobile apps are assigned a specific storage
location for their data. As you use a mobile app, anything that's changed or created with that
app will end up in that apps assigned storage
location or cache. So resetting a mobile app to
how it was when it was first installed is a simple as
deleting or clearing the cache. In your IT support role, you might help people
troubleshoot mobile apps. Clearing the cache will
remove all changes to the settings and sign out of any accounts that the
app was signed into. It might not be the first
thing you should try when trying to wrinkle
in unruly app. But it is a great technique for when things are really broken. Check out the
supplemental reading for a guy on how to do this. Mobile devices will
usually be configured to check for app updates
on a regular schedule. In IT support, you might need to make sure
an app is updated. You'll find details
on how to check for app updates in the
supplemental reading.
