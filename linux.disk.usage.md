In the last lesson, we saw how to view the disk utilization on your computer in
Windows. In Linux, we do this using the du -h command. The du or disk usage
command shows us the disk usage of a specific directory. If you don't specify a
directory, it'll default to your current one. The -h flag gives you the data
measurements in human readable form. You should use the du command if you want
to know how much data space is being used by files in a directory. Another
command you can use if you want to know how much free space you have on your
machine is the df command, or disk free. This shows you the free space available
on your entire machine. The -h flag gives you the data measurements in human
readable form. You should use the df command if you want to know how much free
space you have on your entire system. You might have noticed that we didn't
really touch on file system defragmentation for Linux. Linux generally does a
good job of avoiding fragmentation more than Windows. We won't get into this in
depth, but you can learn more in the next supplemental reading. In common IT
scenarios, you might find yourself running low on disk space. It's up to you to
investigate what files and folders are taking up space, and if you need to, to
remove these files. As always, make sure to be super careful when removing
files.
