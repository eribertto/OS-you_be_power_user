We learned how to install an operating system for ourselves, but when you work
in an IT support role, you have to install operating systems for everyone else.
Installing an operating system with a single USB stick like we did in the very
early lessons of this program, can get extremely time consuming, especially when
you need to do it for lots of machines. Fortunately, in the IT world we use
fantastic tools to make our jobs easier. Remember that imaging a machine, means
to format a machine with an image of another machine. This includes everything,
from the operating system to the settings. In this lesson, we are going to
briefly touch upon some of the options you can use to image machines, and help
deploy operating systems a little easier.
