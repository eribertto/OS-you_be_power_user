To remove files from Linux,
just like in Windows, we can use the rm or remove command. Let's remove this text1 file. And just like that, it's gone. Similar to Windows, we get a message if we try to remove
something that we shouldn't be able to. Let's remove this self_destruct_button. Awesome, everything is
working as intended. Next let's try removing a directory. If you thought to yourself that we need to
also recursively remove this directory, you'd be right,
excellent deduction skills. So rm -r,
let's remove the misc_folder directory. And if we check the misc
folder is now gone. Remember, when using rm command, take extra precaution that you aren't
removing something important by accident.
