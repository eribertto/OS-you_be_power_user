We've already created a few files and directories, but we need a couple more. We don't want to create them off from scratch. So let's make copies instead. In the Windows GUI, all you need to do is right-click, copy, then paste. You can also use hotkeys if you want. A hotkey is a keyboard shortcut that does some sort of task. In Windows, the hotkey for copy is Ctrl-C, and for paste, it's Ctrl-V. In PowerShell, the command used to copy something CP. We also need to add a file that we want to copy and the path of where we want to copy it too. Let's copy mycoolfile.text to the desktop. There you can see mycoolfile.text was added to our desktop. I have a few of these files I want to move over, but I'm feeling a little lazy and don't want to run this command over and over again. So, I'm going to use something called a wildcard to help me copy over multiple files at once. A wildcard is a character that's used to help select files based on a certain pattern. Let's say you want to get all the files that were JPG and copy them somewhere. Then I go on to my documents directory. I have files called hotdog.jpg, cotton-candy. jpg, and pretzel.jpg. I need to come up with a pattern to help me select all these files. What do they have in common besides being named after delicious food? The.jpg extension. Literally, anything else can be in front of the.jpg file extension, and it won't matter. That's what the wildcard asterisk does. It's a pattern for anything. So I'm essentially saying, select all the files with the pattern anything.jpg. So, to copy over all the JPGs in the folder, I can use CP, asterisk symbol,.jpg, and the path I want to copy them to. Let's just verify. There it is. Now, instead of copying files one by one, we can use a single command to get all the files we want. For now, the only select you'll be using is the asterisk for all. Next up, let's say I want to copy over a directory. I'm going to try to copy a folder called Bird Pictures to my desktop. Let's just go back into documents. That's Bird Pictures. Now copy Bird Pictures to desktop. Now, this does exactly what we told you to do. It copies the directory. However, this directory is empty. What it doesn't do, is copy over the contents of the directory. To copy of the contents of a directory, you need to use another command parameter, Recurse. The -Recurse parameter list the contents of the directory. Then if there are any sub-directories in that listing, it'll recurse or repeat the directory listing process for each of those sub-directories. We need to use the -Recurse parameter with copy to copy the contents of the directory along with the directory itself. We're going to use a new parameter Verbose. Copy doesn't output anything to the CLI by default unless there are errors. When we use copy -Verbose, it will output one line for each file the directory being copied. Let's give it a try. Copy Bird Pictures, and the Recurse, and Verbose file. This just messages us that we've already copied Bird Pictures, but what we didn't do, was copy over the file, which is now here. Excellent. Now the directory and all the contents are copied to my desktop.
