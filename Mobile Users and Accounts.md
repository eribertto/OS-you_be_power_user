Because most mobile devices
are used by a single person, mobile operating systems
handle user accounts a little differently than the other OS's we've talked about. Take a GPS unit and a
vehicle, for example. You might never enter a username or sign in
to the GPS unit at all. There are still user
accounts in the OS that run the GPS device but you'll never have to see them or
have to deal with them. On the other hand, think
about a smartphone or tablet running iOS or Android. These devices will have
you enter the username and password once when you're
setting up the device, but then you're probably
not have to reenter that password each time you
want to use the device. The initial account
that you use during setup is called the
primary account. This account is used to create a user profile for
you on the device. The user profile is like your user account
in a mobile device. It contains all of your
accounts, preferences, and apps. In iOS and Android, the primary account
can be used to synchronize settings
and data to the Cloud. When you replace the
device or set up a new mobile device with a primary account that
you've used before, you'll have the option
to restore data and apps if any had been
backed up to the Cloud. But don't worry about this yet. We'll talk more about
synchronization and backups in a future video. Also an iOS and Android, a user profile can be signed
into additional accounts. These could be additional
email accounts, social media accounts
or something else. If given permission, apps
on the mobile device can use these accounts for
single sign-on or SSO. This means that
instead of those apps asking you for another
username and password, they will allow you
to authenticate using an account that
you're already signed into. Those apps don't have
access to your credentials but you can't let them
use those credentials. Check out the security
course to learn more about how SSO works. As an IT support specialist, you might help end users
set up these accounts on their mobile devices but don't ever ask someone
for their password. Always have the end user
enter the password themselves and if anyone reveals
their password to you, encourage them to
change their password. Most mobile devices only support one user profile and they're designed to be
used by a single person. Some Android devices do support
multiple user profiles. To see how that works, check out the
supplemental reading. Think about when you use a
larger device like a desktop, laptop or a server
that you have to enter a username and
password to access. By default, most mobile operating systems
don't ask you to re-enter your primary
account password each time you want
to use the device. This is convenient but it also means that
anyone who picks up the device will
have access to all of your personal and work data. Even if there's no private
data on the device, the device may have access to confidential or
privileged systems which can be just as bad. Mobile operating systems usually have safer ways to
protect your data. You can set a device password, a pin or an unlock
pattern on your device. Some smartphones use
fingerprint sensors, facial recognition
or other kinds of biometric data to grant
access to the device. Biometric data is something about you that's unique to you, like a fingerprint
or voice or a face. We'll talk more
about biometric data in the security course. To protect business data, some organizations use
mobile device management or MDM policies to require
mobile devices to be locked. Mobile device management systems are used to apply and enforce rules about how the device has
to be configured and used. We'll talk more about
MDM in a future video.
