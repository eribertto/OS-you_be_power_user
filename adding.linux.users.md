To add a new user in Linux, you can use the user add command. Sudo useradd juan.
This will set up basic configurations for the user, and set up a home directory.
We can verify that one is created, there. You can combine this with the password
command to make the user change their password and log in. To remove the user,
you can just use sudo userdelete juan. He's no longer on the list. Nice work.
Next we'll dive into the wonderful world of permissions. See you there.
