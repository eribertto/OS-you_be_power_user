Software Packaging and File Archiving on Windows
Introduction
In this lab, you'll learn how to install and remove software in the Windows GUI and CLI, and work with zipped files. You'll install a text editor, called Atom, and extract/un-extract .tar files. You'll also use Chocolatey to install and uninstall programs on Windows.

Head's up: You'll experience a delay as the labs initially load (particularly for Windows labs). So, please wait a couple of minutes for the labs to load. The grade is calculated when the lab is complete, so be sure to hit "End Lab" when you're done!

What you'll do

You have a bunch of tasks for this lab. First, you'll install and remove software using the Windows graphical user-interface (GUI). Second, you'll remove and install software using the Windows Command Line Interface (CLI), known as Powershell. Third, you'll extract and compress files into a .zip archive in the GUI and CLI. Last but not least, you'll use Chocolatey to manage software within the Powershell terminal.
