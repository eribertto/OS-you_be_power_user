To read a simple file in Bash, we can also
use the cat command to view a document. So let's look at important document. The cat command is similar
to the Windows cat command, since it doesn't do a great
job at viewing large files. Instead, we use another command, less. Less does a similar thing that
more does for Windows, but it has more functionality. Fun fact,
there's a Bash command called more, but it's been slowly dying
out in favor of less. It's literally a case of less is more. Similar to more, when we use less we're
launched into an interactive shell. Some of the most common keys
you'll use to navigate this tool are the up and down keys,
page up and page down. g, this moves to the beginning of a file. You can see now we're at the beginning. Capital G,
this moves to the end of a text file. Now we're at the end. Slash and then a word_search. This allows you to search for
a word or phrase. If I type in slash then type
the word I want to search for, I can scan through the text file for
words that match my search. Q, this allows you to quit out of less and
go back to your shell, similar to the q key in
the Windows more command. Do you see how less offers functionality
like searching within a file? Less is a great tool to use
to view files of any size. You'll no doubt end up using this command
often as an IT support specialist. Similar to the Windows cat and
head parameter, we can do the same thing in Linux
using a command called head. This will show you, by default,
the first ten lines of a file. Now what if you wanted to view
the last few lines of a file? You can use a command called tail. This will show you, by default,
the last ten lines of a file.
