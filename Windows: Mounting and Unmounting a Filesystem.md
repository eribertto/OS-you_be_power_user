Now that you've formatted your new file system, there's one more step left. You
have to mount your file system to a drive. In IT, when we refer to mounting
something like a file system or a hard disk, it means that we're making
something accessible to the computer. In this case, we want to make our USB
drive accessible so we mount the file system to a drive. Windows does this for
us automatically. You might have noticed this if you plug in a USB drive, it'll
show up on your list of drives and you can start using it right away. When
you're done using the drive, you'll just have to safely eject or essentially
unmount the drive by right clicking and selecting eject. We'll talk about why
this is important in a later lesson.
