What if we wanted to search for something within a directory, like looking for just the executables in that same directory. This is where the command parameter -filter comes in. I'm just going to LS my programs files here with the -recurse, -filter and look for exes. Well, that's lots of exes. The -filter parameter will filter the results for file names that match a pattern. The Asterisk means match anything. And the.exe Is the file extension for executable files in windows. So the only results we're going to get are the files that end in.exe. Cool.
