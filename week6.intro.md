You've made it all the way to the last module of this course. Great job. So far,
you've learned how to navigate both the Windows and Linux operating systems, how
to set up and manage users, along with how to manage software. You also learn
how to work with disks and file systems on top of working with processes and
hardware resources. That's some seriously great work. The skills you learn in
this course are essential for building a solid technical foundation as an IT
Support Specialist. Now let's finish strong. In the next few lessons, we're
going to wrap up the course with some of the more practical aspects of operating
systems that you'll use all the time in IT support. Let's get started.
