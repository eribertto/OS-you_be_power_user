So far, we've discussed how to read and modify files. But we haven't covered how to edit file contents yet. Spoiler alert, you're about to learn. You can edit text based files in notepad, which we used earlier to view a text file. Notepad is great for basic editing. But when making changes to configuration files, scripts, or other complex text files, you might want something with more features. There are lots of good editors out there for the Windows GUI. For this demonstration, we'll use one called Notepad++. Notepad++, which you can access from the next supplemental reading, is an excellent open source text editor, with support for lots of different file types. Notepad++ can open multiple files and tabs. It also does syntax highlighting for known file types, and has a whole bunch of advanced text editing features. Syntax highlighting is a feature that a lot of text editors provide. It displays text in different colors and fonts to help you categorize things differently. We've already installed Notepad++ on our machine. So, you can check out their website and do the same. Now, you can edit any file using Notepad++ by right clicking it and selecting edit with Notepad++. What if you wanted to edit a file from the CLI? Unfortunately, there's no good default editor in the Powershell terminal. But we can launch our Notepad++ text editor from the CLI and begin modifying text that way. So start, Notepad++, and then just a filename. As you can see, it opened up Notepad++, and asked if I wanted to create this file. If you'd like to read about text editors that you can specifically use in the CLI, check out the supplemental reading on an advanced text editor called Vim.
