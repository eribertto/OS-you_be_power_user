Welcome back, four modules down, two to
go in this course, great work so far. In the last lesson,
we learned how to partition and set up disks with file systems
to start storing files. We also dove deeper into
the details of file systems, and even learned tools for
repairing corrupt file systems and disks. In this lesson,
we're going to talk about processes. Processes play an important part
in our computer user experience. After all, why use a computer
if you can't use any programs? With more and
more processes running on our computer, we have to think about ways to better
utilize our hardware resources. Get ready, because we're going to get
into the nitty gritty of processes. We'll talk about how to
read process output, and learn how to track our resources. Ready, set, let's go!
