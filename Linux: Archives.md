7-Zip is also available to use in Linux. We've already installed the package
p7zip-full, which is what the Linux version of 7-Zip is. To extract a file using
7-Zip, use the command 7z and the flag e for extract and then the file you want
to extract. For example, let us extract this tar file in my home directory. And
just like that, we now have the extracted contents. There are lots of other
tools out there for archiving and unarchiving files. One tool that lots of
people use, that's already installed on most Linux distros is the tar command.
We won't go over how to use this command, but if you'd like to read more about
it, check out the next supplemental reading. You'll see lots of different types
of archives as you work with Windows and Linux. Just keep in mind that different
archive types might require different commands to extract. So, you've learned
what the standalone packages are for Windows and Linux along with some of the
common archive types. Well done. Next we'll dive a little deeper into packages
and some issues you might encounter when you install a standalone package.
