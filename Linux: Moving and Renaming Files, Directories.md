The exact same command can be used for
Linux. Mv, or move, can rename and
move files in directories. Same thing applies here. I'm going to move my red_document and rename it to blue_document. Now we can see it's been
renamed to blue_document. Then, I'm going to move the blue_document
in to the documents folder. There it is. Using wildcards, we can move multiple
files at once, just like Windows. Let's move all of the underscored document files here to our desktop. Now if we check the desktop,
there they are.
